# Squabby ![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/LonerLena/Squabby?style=for-the-badge)

An open source social media platform that doesn't follow the like culture.


## Squabby what?

Squabby aims to be a social media platform that isn't all about getting likes and followers.
Whilst doing this we still want to show you trending threads. Share your interest on a board 
or talk about how cute your dog is on your own profile. Send a private message to a close friend or
share your new guitar on a board.



## Why Squabby?

### Customization 

Squabby gives you the ability to customize your board or profile to your own likings. With custom css
and an editor you can really make your board or profile your own.

### Privacy

Squabby will allow you to create an account without having an actual profile, username etc. 
We'll generate a key for your anonymous account so you can always get back to where you left off and resume conversations in threads.
We aim to give anonymous users as much freedom as a normal user, so you can explore and express your opinion in all kinds of boards.

Squabby will also never suggest a board, profile or thread to you.
We won't be saving data that isn't necessary, so you can browse Squabby freely.

Because of its open source nature, people can read through the code, suggest changes or even present us code that we could implement.

Private, freedom, clear.

### No likes, follower counts, comment counts.

This is a difficult one. As of late people really care about how many followers they have, how many likes their post get, etc.
We want to get rid of that so you don't feel like changing yourself. Squabby will show a percentage ratio of likes and dislikes instead.

> “On a social-media network, it’s very much like being in a heroin bubble. As a radical artist in the 1970s, you used to go and take heroin and wander through the chaos and the collapsing Lower East Side, and  you felt safe. That’s very like now. You know you aren’t safe, but you  feel safe because everyone is like you. But you don’t have to take heroin, so it’s brilliant. You don’t get addicted, or maybe you do. Mostly you do.” - Adam Curtis

But wait, how do I know if my post is getting more interactions?
We'll have an indicator of how trending a post is. More on this *later*.
